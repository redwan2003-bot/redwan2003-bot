### 🚀 About Me

Driven by precision—from deep-space analysis to micro-circuit optimization, I build systems where reliable backend logic meets robust hardware performance.  
- 🎓 BSc in Computer Science & Engineering @ United International University (UIU)  
- 🤖 Backend Developer (Software Team) & Hardware Specialist (R&D Team) @ UIU Robotics Club  
- 🛰️ 2× Bronze Honor – International Astronomy & Astrophysics Competition (IAAC) 2021, 2023  
- 🌌 Global Finalist – International Astronomy and Asteroid Search Campaign (IASC) 2019, 2020  
- 🛠 EasyEDA Campus Promotion Ambassador, promoting professional-grade PCB design workflows  

I love designing high-torque robotic systems, optimizing PCB chassis motherboards, and building low-latency ESP32-based robotic backends.
